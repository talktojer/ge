# Galactic Empire - Modern Web Port

A modern web-based port of the classic Galactic Empire BBS door game, built with FastAPI, React, and PostgreSQL.

## üéÆ Game Overview

Galactic Empire is a space exploration and conquest game where players:
- Command ships across a vast galaxy
- Colonize and manage planets
- Engage in tactical space combat
- Form alliances and compete for dominance
- Build economic empires through trade and production

```

2. Set up environment variables:
```bash
cp env.prod.example .env.prod
# Edit .env.prod with your production values
```

3. Deploy:
```bash
