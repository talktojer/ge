    1.0   Introduction


    The MBMGEMAP Galactic Empire Planet Database Extract Utility is designed
		to work in conjunction with MBMGEGRF to provide your users with a tool 
		to generate custom, personal starmaps of your current Galactic Empire 
		Game. 

		Each night in the nightly cleanup MBMGEMAP will process the whole 
		MBMGEPLT.DAT file (it only takes a minute or two). It extracts out a 
		couple key pieces of information on each sector, planet, and wormhole 
		and writes it to the encrypted MBMGEPLT.MAP file. This file can then
		be downloaded by your users to enable them to render graphic starmaps 
		of your current GE game.

		This greatly enhances the enjoyment of the game by allowing users to 
		visualize the game map they are playing on. Additionally, with the 
		registered version of MBMGEGRF your users can generate GIF or PCX
		images that they can print and edit to suit themselves.
		
    This document describes the procedures to install and operate this 
    software. Please read it carefully prior to installation.

    another directory, please substitute your drive and directory for the 
    "C:\BBSV6" above.

    The install procedure will copy the appropriate files to BBSV6
    directory with sample databases ready to generate starmaps on.




    3.1   Upgrade from a release diskette

    4.0   Operations


    MBMGEMAP is a simple program to operate. If you forget the command line 
    options simply run the program with the "-?" switch as follows;

    MBMGEMAP -?

    This will display a complete list of the command line options available
    as follows;

    USAGE:

     MBMGEMAP [-options]


		    -nxxxxxxxx      8 Digit GE Registration #

				                This is your 8 digit Galactic Empire Activation code.
												If you have forgotten this code simply look in the
												MBMGEMSG.MSG file.



		Examples:

   		mbmgemap -n12345678




    4.0    Operations (cont.)

		A batch file GECLEAN.BAT has been provided as an example how to automate
		the nightly generation of the map file. This batch should be appended
		to the end of your existing BBSCLEAN.BAT (if you have one). If you don't
		already have a BBSCLEAN.BAT use this batch as a sample one.

		Note: You will also need to create a Library directory to hold the
		nightly map file so your users can download it. You will need to use
		the library options to manually log in the file the first time and then
		can simply copy the new version into the library each night. In the
		example GECLEAN.BAT file I chose GEMAPS as the library name. You may 
		choose any name you like by simply changing the copy command in the 
		BBSCLEAN.BAT you create (or update).

		Some sysops may choose to use the GALUTIL utility to update the library
		so that it accurately reflects the file date and file size. Please 
		refer to your MajorBBS operations manual for information on GALUTIL.
