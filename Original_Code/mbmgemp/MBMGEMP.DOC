    1.0 Introduction

    It is 3250 in the standard year, 975 years since man has developed
    inter-planetary space navigation, and 412 years since neutron flux
    warp technology was perfected by the ship builders of Zygor. They
    currently lead the industry with the state of the art ships and
    weapons systems.

    These are good times where a commander with a good ship and some
    business sense can make himself very very rich. Many of the planets
    in the known universe are ideal for basing industries to supply the
    demands of the interstellar fleet. These are also times when the less
    scrupulous commanders can overrun a distant settlement and claim the
    planet for his own. It is not a good idea to leave a distant
    settlement unprotected and the Galactic Command (an ad hoc legal
    body) recommends that commanders check up on their colonists
    regularly.

    Once you have secured your ship, it is yours to command and keep
    maintained. The Zygorians will outfit you with enough supplies to get
    you started but you will surely run out if you encounter any rouge
    ships. The Galactic Command recommends you find and settle some
    planets immediately to secure a supply source for your ship. Or you
    can purchase supplies from other commanders with whom you have
    established trade agreements.

    The object of the game is to build and maintain as large an empire as
    you can sustain, using any means you find appropriate. You can do
    this by yourself or with a team of other players. Your System
    Operator will inform you of the prizes and awards for becoming the
    top player(s) in the game.

    Good luck and beware the dreaded Cybertrons at all cost.





    2.0  Game Environment

    The game takes place in a universe with millions of sectors and
    thousands of known planets. Each sector is 10000 by 10000 parsecs
    square. The entire navigable galaxy is 6000 by 6000 sectors
    numbered from the center of the galaxy to the edges. Sectors are
    mapped on a two coordinate system giving a galactic map that looks
    something like this;

       +--------------------------------------+
       |-300,-300                    +300,-300|
       |                                      |

       |                                      |
       |-300,+300                    +300,+300|
       +--------------------------------------+

    Each sector is measured 10000 by 10000 parsecs square measured from the
    top left to bottom right as follows;

       +--------------------------------------+
       |0,0                             0,9999|

       |9999,0                       9999,9999|
       +--------------------------------------+


    In each sector there may be between 0 and 9 planetary bodies. Each
    planet has various environmental and resource qualities. The best
    planet has very good resources and a very good environment.

    Sector 0 0 is governed by the Galactic Command and is a declared
    neutral zone. This policy is maintained by the enforcer planet
    Enforcer-9. A single hostile action by any player in this sector will
    be met with a swift and preemptive strike from the Galactic Commands
    top secret weapons base on Enforcer-9.  


    Sector 0 0 also has the first planet Zygor, the leaders in state-
    of-the-art weapons and ship hardware. Zygor manufactures the various
    ships and the weapons they carry. It is also home of the Galactic
    Monetary Reserve Fund, the only duly authorized financial institution
    in the Galaxy.

    Planet number two in Sector 0 0 is Tahanian Station, a embarking
    station for colonists and mercenary soldiers. This is also where you
    can purchase food supplies.

    There are several wormholes in sector 0 0 which provide portals to 
    other distant sectors.

    Once out of Sector 0 0 it is a free for all, and you have to decide
    how to best defend yourself and your planets.

    Additionally Sector 0 0 has three portals (stable wormholes) to other
    parts of the galaxy. These can be used to help you cross the galaxy
    faster or to escape enemy ships.




    3.0  Your First Ship

    Your first ship is an Interceptor class fighter. It is outfitted with
    neutron flux warp drives and standard sub-warp impulse drives. The
    impulse drives can attain speeds of up to .99 percent light speed
    while the flux drives can attain warp 5.

    The Interceptor is an extremely fast response, light weight fighter
    designed for scouting. It is outfitted with Mark-1 shields and Mark-1
    phasers, hyper-phasers, torpedoes, and defensive decoys. The torpedoes
    are controlled by a Fire Control System that locks onto the target
    and guides the weapon to the target. Torpedoes are very fast and
    carry a fixed but powerful charge, and cannot be used when in hyper
    space.

    The phasers are line-of-sight weapons which you fire in a specific
    direction. Hyper-phasers are automatically chosen when in hyper-space
    as they are the more powerful weapon, taking hyper-energy directly
    off the neutron flux. Plasma-phasers have an additional feature of
    being focus able allowing you to create a wider beam that has less
    "punch" but is easier to score a hit on a moving target.

    The Interceptor has defensive systems that include deflector shields,
    and decoy's. The deflector shields are useful for protecting from
    plasma-phasers, and lightly charged missiles, but will not stand up
    to many torpedo blasts. Decoys are small drone ships used to
    distract, confuse, and divert incoming missiles and torpedoes. It
    gives off an electronic image that resembles a much larger ship, will
    attract an incoming weapon, and self destruct destroying the incoming
    weapon.

    The ship has a communications console with three separate
    transmission channels. You can set each to a specific channel or to
    the HAIL setting which permits you to receive all general hailing
    messages. If you create alliances you can set one radio to an agreed
    upon channel and have a private and secure communications path
    between members of your alliance.

    Finally, your ship has facilities to support a small complement of
    colonists, troops, fighters, and supplies. The ship can hold a maximum
    of 500 tons of these supplies.






    4.0 Navigating

    An explanation of the coordinate system and some of the terms used in
    navigating in the galaxy will help you get started. Galactic Empire
    functions on a 360 degree compass and is strictly two dimensional.
    The major bearings are illustrated as follow;


                   315  0  45
                      \ | /
                       \|/
                 270----*----90
                       /|\
                      / | \
                   225 180 135


    BEARING - Bearing is always used to indicate where a particular ship
    or planet is in relation to you. It is relative to the direction you
    are facing and expressed in a number from -180 to +180. If a object
    is bearing -90, it is to the left of you, if +90 it is to the right
    of you, if 0 it is directly in front of you, and if - or + 180 it is
    directly behind you.

    HEADING - Heading is the relative direction of the other ship. It is
    used to indicate when a ship is facing toward or away from you. A
    heading of 0 means the ship is facing toward you, while a heading of
    180 is away from you.

    GALACTIC HEADING - This is the absolute heading in the galaxy. A
    galactic heading of 0 means you (or the other ship) is facing north
    up.

    WORMHOLES - Wormholes are fairly rare galactic anomalies caused by a
    paired spatial singularity. The effect it to create a means of
    "leaping" across the galaxy to another sector. To navigate through a
    wormhole you must carefully approach it directly at about 1/4
    impulse. You will be pulled into the wormhole and emerge at the
    terminal sector. If you approach too fast you will simply miss the
    event horizon. If you approach too slow you may oscillate between
    terminal sectors. Each time you pass through a wormhole some damage
    to systems may occur. Passing through a wormhole while severely
    damaged is not recommended. Wormholes are usually by-directional but
    an even rarer form of one way wormhole has been speculated to exist.

    The NAV command can be used to assist with inter-sector navigation.
    It will always produce a direction and distance to the upper-left
    corner of a sector.







    5.0 Owning Planets

    In order to build up wealth you must colonize planets and maintain
    them.  Planets are claimed by simply going into orbit around one and
    using the ADMIN command. You should be choosy at first about which
    planets you put a population on, as surviving on a poor planet can be
    very difficult and require frequent supply runs.

    Planets are rated on two factors, resources, and environment, with
    the following categories, POOR, MARGINAL, GOOD, and VERY GOOD. The
    resources factor rates the natural resources of the planet. A rating
    of good or very good will insure that your population has plenty of
    natural resources to use in the establishment of the colony, and the
    manufacture of goods. The environment factor rates the hospitality of
    the planet and how difficult it will be for a colony to survive.  A
    rating of good, or very good, will insure that the majority of their
    efforts go toward producing goods and not simply surviving.

    Once you have claimed a planet you need to establish a population on
    it.  This is done with the TRANSFER command to shuttle items from
    your ship to the planet. Once a colony is established they become an
    somewhat independent society. Anything you transfer to the planet
    belongs to them, you cannot transfer it back. If you wish to retrieve
    items from a planet you must purchase them from the planet at the
    base price.

    It is a good idea to leave some additional items on a planet besides
    men.  They are;

    FOOD - If you fail to leave food on the planet you will find your men
    and troops all dead when you return next time. It is a good idea to
    leave a case for each 10 men & troops you have.

    TROOPS - Troops are mercenaries who produce nothing but serve to
    defend your planet from outside attacks, and squelch social unrest. 
    They must be fed well, and will fight to the death when attacked.

    FIGHTERS - Fighters will defend your planet from both ground troop
    invasions and fighter attacks. They provide a primary defense force
    for your planet. Your troops will not be called into action unless
    the fighters are all destroyed.

    ION CANNON - This is a large defensive cannon which will attack any
    hostile ship that is in orbit around your planet. It will fire once
    every few seconds, and can destroy a ship in just a few blasts.  An
    attacking ship won't stay long with an ion cannon firing upon them. 
    You can have multiple ion cannons, but only one will be active at a
    time.






    There are several other factors you may adjust when you establish a
    planet. When the planet is first established your colony is instructed
    to divide their efforts evenly between the manufacture of food and the
    pro-creation of population (an ardous chore to be sure) You may wish 
    to alter this to provide for the production of supplies or let your
    planet grow at maximum rate, its up to you.

    Additionally, you can tax your planet at a specific rate. The harsher
    the tax the less the productivity. Tax is your principle source of
    income for purchasing supplies for your ship. This tax is kept in the
    planetary bank until you arrive to collect it.

    The higher the taxes the more social unrest there is likely to be.
    Troops must be maintained to keep the social discontent from becoming
    a full scale revolt.

    Your colony will produce all the supplies you need for your ship if
    managed properly. These goods are cheapest at your own planets as
    Zygor charges three times the base rate for goods. The cash you spend
    on supplies goes into the planetary bank and is used to purchase more
    raw materials when the Inter-galactic supply ships come around.

    You can decide to sell supplies to other players if you like, and
    even mark up the price to other players. If you wish to be selective
    in who can purchase from your planets you can establish a trade
    password for your planet and only those who know the password can buy
    from you.  This is also useful in establishing an alliance with other
    players where you all would set your planets to the same password and
    agree on the price to charge each other. Non-members will be excluded
    from trading with your alliance.

    Remember that the better your planet, the more attractive it is to
    marauders. Nothing can take the place of a well rounded defense system
    and frequent supply runs. Leaving a planet un-checked for more than a
    few days may spell disaster for your colony.






    6.0 Game Strategy

    Your ship is equipped with nothing when you first enter the game, you
    are not in any eminent danger as sector 0 0 is a neutral zone. You
    are provided with an interceptor and an amount of cash with which you
    must decide what you are going to do.

    On Zygor you can purchase shield systems, phaser systems, missiles, 
    torpedoes, fighters, decoys, and ion cannons. Note: some of these may
    not be available or useful on some ship classes (see HELP CLASS for
    more information).

    On Tahanian Station you can purchase colonists (men), troops, and
    food.  Your first goal should be to secure an income for yourself,
    and therefore provide a source for taxes you will need to expand your
    empire, and keep your ships fully stocked.  To do this you should
    purchase men, troops, food, and some fighters.  Locate as good a
    planet as you can find and colonize it. It is advisable that you
    steer clear of other ships unless you know they are friendly.

    An alternative, albeit somewhat immoral, strategy is to purchase
    weapons and lie waiting for other ships to leave sector 0 0. When
    they do mount an attack and upon destroying their ship, gain what
    remains of the supplies on their ship. After several successful
    attacks you may have enough to colonize a planet or two.

    When you do colonize a planet you should redirect the majority of the
    effort to producing men, food, and troops, and gaining cash with which
    you can purchase larger and more powerful ships and expand your
    empire.

    Remember, these are only a couple suggested strategies, and others
    are only limited by your imagination.







    7.0  Battle Strategy

    The flexibility of Galactic Empire precludes an exhaustive discussion
    of all the strategies involved in user versus user battling. Some
    suggestions are simply put forth here to get you started.

    When in a potential battle situation make sure your shields are up,
    and keep moving. The easiest target is a ship with shields down,
    sitting still.

    If your ship has a cloaking system, use it sparingly as it consumes
    incredible amounts of energy. It is most useful in covering a
    retreat.

    If you have incoming torpedoes you can ditch them easily by making a
    jump to light speed. This does not work for missiles though.

    Launching decoys does not guarantee that the incoming missiles or
    torpedoes will be destroyed. Launching more decoys than incoming
    weapons increases the chance of destroying an incoming weapon.

    When launching an attack try to get close to the target and use the
    faster torpedoes as they will have less time to react.

    If a target goes to light speed be prepared to make the jump with him
    and use Hyper-Phasers as soon as you pass warp 1.

    If you get hit with a Hyper-Phaser immediately go into a series of
    180 degree high speed turns as your opponent will have difficulty
    locating you. Go out of light speed in another sector and immediately
    cloak (if you have a cloaking system) as a last ditch effort to loose
    your pursuers.

    Form alliances to help protect each other from marauders. Remember
    two ships are twice as powerful as one.

    When you are under attack you cannot EXIT the game to avoid your
    attackers. If you hang-up while you are under attack your ship will
    be destroyed. Remember "Death before Dishonor"!!

    If you are damaged try to make it back to sector 0 0 or to one of your
    own planets where you can get your ship repaired with the MAINT
    command.  Remember the cost for everything is much more expensive in
    Sector 0 0.

    When you kill another ship you will get some of his goods on his
    ship.  This can be very helpful when you are running low.

    When you want to find another player in hyper space use the SCAN RA
    command if the player is close or SCAN LO if the player is far away.
    The long range scanner will tell you where another player is in the
    galaxy.







    8.0  Planetary Battles

    Planets can defend themselves with troops, fighters, and ion cannons. 
    If you have no troops or fighters then your planet can be easily
    overrun.

    FIGHTERS are Nova Class Battle Fighters commanded by a fully
    automated tactical computer. They have inboard and outboard photon
    cannons capable of powerful and deadly offensive and defensive
    attacks. When pitted against troops the fighter is deadly, capable of
    taking out between 10 and 50 troops in a pass. When pitted against
    other fighters they are fairly evenly matched.

    TROOPS are trained mercenaries, and serve no other function than the
    defense or attack on a planet. The consume food, maintain there
    skills, and mostly play cards. But when needed they will fight to the
    death.

    ION CANNONS are the very powerful fixed focus, ion-plasma
    transmitters, capable of taking out a Star Class ship with only a few
    strikes. They are strictly defensive weapons controlled by a fully
    automated system.  When the planet comes under attack they will
    automatically locate the attacker and commence firing upon the ship.

    When attacking a planet you are always at a disadvantage, as the
    local troops and fighters are better supported and fresh. Knowing
    this you should always plan on commencing a battle with superior
    numbers.

    Begin with a fighter attack. If they have no fighters you will
    overpower the troops rather quickly. If they have fighters you will
    be in a better position to do battle.

    After each wave your fighters or troops will return to your ship. If
    you wish to send them back you can do so. Remember, you will not take
    a planet so long as 1 fighter or 1 squad of troops (5) exists on the
    planet.





    9.0  Cyborgs and Cybertrons

    Cyborgs are a race of automatons which are bent on the destruction of
    all humans from the universe. They command a class of ship
    manufactured specifically for them, the Cybertron. Both pilot and
    ship function as a single fighting unit and they can be quite deadly.

    The Cybertron is armed with phasers, and torpedoes, but has no
    missile capability. They can be deadly in hyper space with
    hyper-phasers, but cannot recycle the phaser as fast as most other
    ships. Cybertrons are prone to battle failure, and they will
    malfunction occasionally. This is often noted  by strange
    transmissions from their ship.

    When attacked the Cybertron may summon other Cyborg Class ships to aid
    in the battle. If a Cybertron gets damaged too much they may launch
    jammers to cover a retreat. Be careful as they may often mine an area
    prior to leaving.

    Finally, Cybertrons will not attack interceptors and freighters
    unless first provoked, so don't mess with them unless you know what
    you are doing.






    10.0  Scoring

    The Score Board is updated in real time and each night, during the
    nightly cleanup of the system. 

    Scores are based upon the size of your empire and the number and class
    of kills you have accumulated is ship to ship combat. Each class of
    ship is worth a different number of points as detailed below;

    Interceptor                10
    Light Freighter            25
    Heavy Freighter            75
    Destroyer                 150
    Star Cruiser              200
    Battle Cruiser            250
    Frigate                   300
    Dreadnought               500
    Freight Barge             200
    Cybertron Scout            75
    Cybertron Battle Cruiser  200

    Additionally you are awarded as a bonus, a small percentage of the
    killed players score on top of the ship points. 

    Finally, when you kill another player, his score goes down also. 
    This means that you can actually knock him down on the top player
    list making it easier to overtake him (or pass him further).

    While you can quickly gain a good score with points gained from ship
    to ship combat, over the long haul the scoring system awards the
    highest scores to players who create planetary empires and manage
    them well.

    11.1  ABANDON - Abandon a planet previously claimed

    The abandon command will release ownership of a planet previously
    claimed.  You must be in orbit around the planet to be abandoned. 
    Issue the abandon command as follows;

    abandon

    simple enough.


    11.2  ABORT - Abort a self destruct sequence

    This command will abort a self destruct sequence.


    11.3  ADMIN    - claim and administer a planet once in orbit.

    This command is used to claim and administer a planet. If the planet
    is un-owned then you will be asked if you wish to settle it;

        Do you wish to settle this planet, Sir! (y/n)? --->

    If you respond YES then you own the planet and will be prompted;

        The Protocol Officer requests an appropriate name for the
        planet Sir, (20 characters max) --->

    Once you declare a name you can now adjust your policies with the
    ADMINISTRATION MENU.

        --------------------------------------

    "Rate" is the percentage of the effort of the population being put
    into the production of this item. The total of all items cannot
    exceed 100%.

    "Qty" is the number on hand.

    "Price" is the base price set by the Galactic Command. You cannot
    charge any less than this amount. This is also the price charged to
    the "owner" of this planet for each good (explained further below).

    "Resv" is the number of each item to reserve for the use of the
    population or the "owner". Your colonists will only sell what is in
    excess of this amount.

    "S" is the flag indicating whether this good is for sale at all. A
    "N" indicates that it is not for sale, while a "Y" means that it is.

    "Mkup" is the amount over the price to charge for each item. The
    "owner" will not be charged the marked up price, only other players.

    "Sold" is the quantity of the item sold.

    "Cash in Planetary Bank" is cash that has been paid for goods sold. 
    This cash is not available to the owner as it belongs to the
    colonists.  They will use it to purchase raw materials from Galactic
    Command Supply Ships.  Having a cash surplus enhances the production
    of goods.






    "Tax revenue" is the amount of taxes collected from the colonists.
    This amount is available to the "owner" and can be collected with
    selection #2.

    "Tax Rate" is the percentage of tax being assessed on the colonists. 
    The higher the tax the more tax revenue collected, but the lower the
    production of the colonists. A tax rate of 100% will assess a 1 C tax
    per person per day. Example: in the above display there are 1911
    colonists, and a tax rate of 50%. This will generate 955 C's each
    day.

    "Trade Password" is the password you have set with selection #6. This
    password will be asked of anyone before they can buy any goods. It is
    also asked prior to permitting a ship to get repairs at your planet.
    If set to "none" then no password will be required.

    2 - Will permit you to collect taxes from the planetary bank and
    place them on your ship. The Galactic Command recommends you do this
    often as an attacker will gain all the taxes if they overtake your
    planet.

    3 - Will permit you to adjust your policies concerning a given item. 
    When selected the following menu is displayed;

        Select the item to adjust
        ----------------------------
          men  = adjust men
          mis  = adjust missiles
          tor  = adjust torpedoes
          ion  = adjust ion cannons
          flu  = adjust flux pods
          foo  = adjust food
          fig  = adjust fighters
          dec  = adjust decoys
          tro  = adjust troops
          zip  = adjust zippers
          jam  = adjust jammers
          min  = adjust mines
        ----------------------------
        Select now -->

    Select an item to adjust and you will be prompted;

        Select the percentage of effort toward men. --->

    Select an amount between 0 and 100 percent. Remember if you already
    have assigned most of the activity you may need to first reduce an
    item before increasing one.

        Charge how much for Men. --->

    Enter the amount to charge to other ships, if you are not going to
    sell this can be 0.




         Sell men to other ships? (y/n) --->

    Enter Y if you wish to permit anyone (yourself included) to purchase
    goods from this planet, enter N if not.

       Reserve how many men for stock piling --->

    Enter an amount of goods to reserve for yourself, or the planet. This
    is useful in preventing another ship from purchasing too many goods
    (such as fighters) and endangering the colony.

    4 - Will permit you to change the name of the planet. You will be
    prompted;

        The Protocol Officer requests an appropriate name for the
        planet Sir, (20 characters max) --->

    5 - Will permit you to set the tax rate to charge the colonists, you
    will be prompted as follows;

        Enter the new TAX rate (0 - 100) --->

    A tax rate of 0 will entice the colonists to produce as much as
    possible, while a tax rate of 100% will reduce their productivity to
    20% of full production.

    6 - Will prompt you for the new trade password as follows;

        Enter the new password "team" or "none"  --->

    If you enter the word "team" the planet becomes a team planet and any
    member of your current team can trade with your planet. If you change
    teams later you MUST change the password to "team" AGAIN as this is 
    when the team ID is read and recorded.

    If you enter the word "none" there will be no trade password in
    effect.  Any other word will become the trade password. This is
    useful for creating alliances as all the members of an alliance can
    set their password to the same word and all can trade and get repairs
    from each other.

    7 - Will set a beacon message that is broadcast to all ships who come
    within range of your planet.

    X - Will return you to command mode.




    11.4  ATTACK  -  Attack a planet with Fighters or Troops

    Issue the Attack command as follows;

         attack [<number>] [tro/fig]

         number = number of troops or fighters to attack with;

         tro = send <number> troops to the surface.
         fig = send <number> fighters to the surface.

    Examples: attack 100 tro
              attack 30 fighters

    Provided you have sufficient fighters or troops to send to the planet
    the battle will commence, you will see a blow by blow report of the
    progress of the battle. After the attack, and provided there are any
    survivors, your remaining forces will return to the ship. You can
    then decide to attack again, or lick your wounds and go away.

    If the planet has an Ion Cannon then any hostilities will trigger the
    ion cannon to fire. The Ion Cannon will continue to fire so long as
    you are in orbit.

    Should your attacking forces meet little or no resistance than you
    will conquer the planet and its goods, funds, and civilization is
    yours.

    TIP: Match fighters against fighters and troops against troops. If
    fighters are present on the planet, begin with a fighter attack until
    the fighters are knocked out. Then proceed with a ground assault
    using troops.  Pitting troops against fighters will yield
    disappointing results.






    11.5  BUY  -  Buy goods or colonists from a planet

    The Buy command will permit you to purchase goods from one of your
    own planets or another players planet. Issue the Buy command as
    follows;

    buy [<number>] [men/tro/mis/tor/ion/flu/foo/fig/dec/min/jam/zip/gol]
        [<password>]

    number = the number you want to buy.

      men  = buy men
      tro  = buy troops
      mis  = buy missiles
      tor  = buy torpedoes
      ion  = buy ion cannons
      flu  = buy flux pods
      foo  = buy food
      fig  = buy fighters
      dec  = buy decoys
      min  = buy mines
      jam  = buy jammers
      zip  = buy zippers
      gol  = buy gold

      password = optional trade password may be required by planet.

    examples:
      buy 1000 men
      buy 3 ion
      buy 500 foo drowssap

    All goods put onboard your ship must be purchased, or if permitted,
    transferred up. The cash will go towards improving the general
    conditions of the population. Additionally the population will use
    the cash to purchase more supplies and increase its production
    levels.


    11.6  CLOAK - Turn on or off the cloaking system

    The Cloak command will turn on or off the cloaking system, if your
    ship is equipped. The cloaking system consumes large amounts of power
    and you should be careful not to drain all your energy pool. Due to the
    time it takes to charge the ST-Coils there is a few seconds of delay 
    before the ship actually becomes invisible.

    Issue the command as;

    Cloak [ON/OFF]

    Example:  cloak on
              cloak off


    11.7 CLS - Clear the screen using ANSI Clear Screen Sequence.

    The CLS command is useful if your screen becomes cluttered and you
    want to clear it.







    11.8  DECOY - deploy a decoy

    The Decoy command deploys a single decoy. Decoys proceed away from
    your ship and send a sensor signature that resembles your ship. If a
    torpedo or missile comes near the decoy the decoy will explode and
    destroy the inbound weapon. The decoy will self destruct after a
    period of time to prevent stray decoys floating around in your
    navigation path.


    11.9  DESTRUCT - Start the self destruct sequence

    The Destruct command will begin a self destruct countdown timer that
    when it reaches zero will destroy your ship. The countdown can be
    aborted with the ABORT command.


    11.10  FLUX - Load a new flux pod into the neutron engines

    The Flux command will replace an exhausted Flux Pod from the energy
    pool with a new one. This command presumes that you want it changed
    now, and does not warn you if there is still a good percentage of
    power left in the old pod. The old pod is jettisoned. Your power is
    restored to full charge automatically.


    11.11 FREQ - Sets the communications channel frequency

    The freq command permits you to specify the channels you want your
    ships communication system set to.

    Issue the freq command as follows;

         freq [<channel>] [hail/<freq>]

         <channel> = Your communications channel A, B, or C as set by
                     the FREQ command.

         hail      = Sets the channel to accept all hailing messages.

         <freq>    = The frequency to set this channel to.

     examples: freq A 12345
               freq b hail
               freq c 23221

     note: Channel frequencies above 20000 are converted to hyper space
              modulation packets and transmitted through hyper space.

           Channel frequencies below 20000 are transmitted in the current
              star system only.







    11.12  HELP - Display help information

    Issue the help command as follows;

    help [<topic>/<command>]

    Commands: abandon abort  admin  attack  buy  cloak  cls  decoy 
          destruct flux  freq  help  impulse  jammer  maintenance  
          mine  missile  new  orbit  phaser  planet price rename  
          report  roster  rotate  scan  send  set  shield  torpedo  
          transfer  warp  zipper

    Topics  : battle  class  communicate  cybertron  galaxy  navigate  
          planets  scoring  sector  starting  strategy

    The Help command will display a vast amount of information on
    Galactic Empire.


    11.13 IMPULSE - Engage the impulse engines

    The Impulse command directs your impulse (sub-light) engines and sets
    your course and speed. Issue the Impulse command as follows;


         impulse [<speed>] [<heading>]

         speed   = the impulse speed between 0 and 99 (99 is .99 light
                   speed)
         heading = the heading from your current direction

    Examples:

         impulse 5 0    would alter the speed to impulse 5 and not
                        change the heading.
         impulse 10 5   would alter the speed to impulse 10 and turn the
                        ship 5 degrees to the starboard (right).
         impulse 10 355 would alter the speed to impulse 10 and turn the
                        ship 5 degrees to the port (left).







    11.14 JAM - Launch a Jammer

    The jammer command will cause a jammer device to be launched. It
    disrupts all scanner systems on all ships within range of the device,
    yours included. It is useful for covering an escape or distracting an
    opponent. 

    Issue the jammer command as follows;

    Jammer

    Simple enough!


    11.145 JETTESON - Jetteson some or all of an item type

    The JET command allows you to dump some or all of a given item. This 
    frees up cargo space for other items. Issue the command as follows;

    jettison [ALL/<number>] [men/tro/mis/tor/ion/flu/foo/fig/dec/min/jam]


    examples:
    jettison ALL ion 
    jettison 500 foo 

      
    11.15 LOCK - Lock fire control on a particular ship

    The Lock command permits you to lock your fire control systems onto a
    specific ship no matter what its letter designation changes to. As
    long as the ship is within scanner range the fire control systems
    will remain locked onto that specific ship. This is extremely useful
    when in heated battle and multiple ships are in the vicinity.  Ship
    letter designated -A- may become -B- or -C- as other ships move
    closer to you. The Lock command permits you to stay locked on to the
    ship as distances and letter designates change. 

    Commands like MISSILE and TORPEDO can be then be used with the Lock
    option to fire on the ship you have locked onto. Issue the Lock
    command as follows;

        lock [<ship letter designate>]
        -or-
        lock

    examples: lock A     would lock onto the closest ship.
              lock B     would lock onto the second closest ship.

              lock       would cause the lock to be released.

    Note: Once a ship is killed the lock is released automatically.






    11.16 MAINTENANCE - Requests maintenance from a planet.

    The Maintenance command functions when you are in orbit at your own
    planet or Zygor. The maintenance crews will start repairing your ship
    and charge you a nominal fee of 200c's at your own planet and 2500c's
    at Zygor.

    Leaving orbit early will cease all repairs on the ship.


    11.17 MINE - Launch a Neutron Mine

    The MINE command causes a neutron mine to be deposited at your
    current location. You specify how long until detonation permitting
    you time to leave the spot for safety. Mines are useful when you are
    being tailed by another ship. Beware that they are very powerful and
    you can also be damaged by them if you don't get far enough away. 
    Issue the MINE command as follows;

      mine [<time>]

      time = the time till detonation in centocks (approx. 5 seconds). 
             This can be set from 1 to 50.

    Example:  mine 10    will deposit a mine to detonate in 10 centocks






    11.18 MISSILE - Fire a missile

    The Missile command instructs your ship to fire a hyper-missile at a
    given ship with a given charge. This missile guidance system will
    attempt to lock on the ship prior to firing the missile. If a lock is
    made the missile is launched. Missiles are slower and you determine
    the amount of charge to place in them. They are basically a
    Hyper-drive engine with a target tracking system, designed to produce
    a Neutron flux implosion of any remaining energy when it nears its
    target. They will continue to track a target into Hyper space to
    deliver its charge.

    Issue the Missile command as follows;

         missile [<ship letter>/@] [<energy>]

         ship letter = the ship you are firing upon
         @           = to fire at the locked on ship
         energy      = the energy from your Neutron Flux Pile to charge
                       into the missile.

    Examples:

         missile A 100   would fire a missile at ship A which will only
                         cause minor (if any) damage.
         missile C 20000 would fire a missile at ship C which will cause
                         major damage.
         missile @ 10000 would fire on the ship that a previous Lock 
                         command has locked on to.


    Note: the energy imparted to the missile must come from your charged
          neutron flux pile and will drain the pile by 10% of that amount.


    11.19 NAVIGATE - Invoke the navigation assist function

    The navigate command will give you a bearing and distance to a
    sector.  Please issue the Navigate command as follows;

    navigate [sector]

    sector number = the sector number you wish to navigate to.

    Examples: navigate sector 0 0   give a bearing and distance to 
                                    sector 0 0.






    11.20 NEW - Purchase a new ship, phaser system, or shields.

    The New command permits you to purchase from the ship yards at Zygor
    one of several types of shields, phaser systems, or even a new ship.

    Issue the New command as follows;

         New [shield/ship/phaser] [<type>]

         type   = the class type of the shield, phaser, or ship you wish
                  to purchase.

           ---- Shields ----   ---- Phasers ----   ------ Ships ------
           Mark-1 Shield = 1   Mark-1 Phaser = 1   Interceptor     = 1
           Mark-2 Shield = 2   Mark-2 Phaser = 2   Light Freighter = 2
           Mark-3 Shield = 3   Mark-3 Phaser = 3   Heavy Freighter = 3
           Mark-4 Shield = 4   Mark-4 Phaser = 4   Destroyer       = 4
           Mark-5 Shield = 5   Mark-5 Phaser = 5   Star Cruiser    = 5
           Mark-6 Shield = 6                       Battle Cruiser  = 6
                                                   Frigate         = 7
                                                   Dreadnought     = 8

    Examples:

         new ship 2    purchase a new Heavy Freighter

    Note: you must be orbiting around Zygor in Sector 0 0 to issue this
          command.

    Prices of shields and phasers can be obtained from the HELP NEWPRICE
    command.


    11.21 ORBIT - Enter into an orbit around a planet

    The Orbit command instructs your ship to enter into orbit around a
    given planet. Issue the Orbit command as follows;

         orbit [<planet #>]

         planet # = the planet you are wishing to orbit.

    Example:

         orbit 2

    Note: You must be 250 or closer to orbit a planet!





    11.22 PHASER - Fires either the normal, or Hyper-phasers.

    The Phaser command directs your ships phasers to fire in a given
    direction with a given beam spread. The more narrow the beam the
    stronger the hit, but the more difficult it is to get a hit.

    Issue the Phaser command as follows;

         phaser [<direction>] [<spread>]

         direction = the heading to fire the phasers at, usually the same
                     as the bearing of another ship given in the "scan sh"
                     command.

         spread    = the focus of the beam (0 to 5). 0 gives the most
                     concentrated beam but is so narrow that you must be
                     dead on to get a hit. 1 and 2 are good numbers to use
                     if you know where a target is located. Use 5 if you
                     know he is close but cloaked.

    Examples:

         phaser 4 1     fire 4 degrees off starboard, focus 1.
         phaser 180 5   fire directly behind focus 5.


    When in hyper space the normal ships phasers are useless. The
    Hyper-Phaser however can be deadly. The Hyper-Phaser Beam is very
    narrow but very powerful and can destroy another ship with only a few
    well placed shots.

    Issue the Hyper-Phaser command as follows;

         phaser [<direction>]

         direction = the heading to fire the phasers at, usually the same
                     as the bearing of another ship given in the "scan sh"
                     command. With the Hyper-Phaser you must be pin-point
                     accurate to score a hit.

    Examples:

         phaser 4    fire 4 degrees off starboard.
         phaser 180  fire directly behind you.

    Note: The Fire Control System automatically switches to Hyper-Phasers
          when in hyper space.

    11.35 TEAM - Perform one of several team functions

    The Team command allows you to perform a number of functions related
    to teams. It allows you to join a team, create a new team, leave a team,
    and get team scores. Additionally the team founder (or anyone with the 
    founder password) can expell a team member, change the Team Password, or
    change the team name.

       TEAM KICK ssssssssss <user name>

           permits a team member with the Founder Password to kick another 
           team member off the team. Note: if you don't also change the 
            password the kicked player can simply rejoin.

           Example: Team Kick toadspit John Doe

       TEAM NEWPASS ssssssssss pppppppppp

           permits a team member with the Founder Passowrd to assign a new 
           Member Password pppppppppp.

       TEAM NEWNAME ssssssssss <team name>

           permits a team member with the Founder Password to change the 
           team name to <team name>.

           Example: Team newname toadspit The Klystron Klan

    NOTE: All the above commands require the team Founder Password. If you
          don't know it then you are not a "founder".



    11.35 TEAM (cont.)

    Team Member commands are;

       TEAM JOIN nnnnn pppppppppp

           permits a player to join the team nnnnn provided they have the 
           correct member password pppppppppp

           Example: Team join 12345 toadspit

             the individual scores divided by the number of team members
             plus a bonus score for each team member (A/B)+(C*B). This
             means that a player with less of an individual score dilutes
             the whole teams score. You can make up for this in numbers
             but the best scores will be larger teams with good individual
             scores.




    11.36 TORPEDO - Fire a torpedo at another ship

    The Torpedo command instructs your ship to fire a torpedo at a given
    ship. This fire control system will attempt to lock on the ship prior
    to firing the torpedo. If a lock is made the torpedo is launched.

    Issue the Torpedo command as follows;


       torpedo [<ship letter>/@] 

       ship letter = the ship you are firing upon
       @           = the locked on ship.

       examples: torpedo A   would fire a torpedo at ship A.
                 torpedo @   would fire at the ship you locked on with
                             the LOCK command.


    11.37 TRANSFER - Transfers freight to a planet

    The Transfer command permits you to transfer goods from your ship to
    a newly established planet, or from a planet to your ship. Issue the
    transfer command as follows;

                                   /min/jam/gol]

        men  = transfer men
        tro  = transfer troops
        mis  = transfer missiles
        tor  = transfer torpedoes
        ion  = transfer ion cannons
        flu  = transfer flux pods
        foo  = transfer food

        gol  = transfer gold

    examples:
        transfer up 3 ion 
        transfer down 500 foo 







    11.38 WARP - Engage the warp drive engines

    The Warp command starts the warp drives (provided your type of ship
    has them) and directs your course and speed.

    Issue the Warp command as follows;

         warp [<speed>] [<heading>]

         speed   = the warp speed between 0 and 50
         heading = the heading from your current direction

    Examples:

         warp 5 0    would alter the speed to warp 5 and not
                     change the heading.
         warp 10 5   would alter the speed to warp 10 and turn the ship
                     5 degrees to the starboard (right).
         warp 10 355 would alter the speed to warp 10 and turn the ship
                     5 degrees to the port (left).

    Note: you can push the warp engines beyond their rated speed for short
    durations. The faster and longer you do this, however, the greater the
    damage to the engines.


    11.39 ZIPPER - Launch a zipper

    The ZIP command launches a defensive (and sometimes offensive) weapon
    which interferes with the timing mechanism on mines. The effect is to
    trip all mines in the vicinity of the players ship into exploding
    immediately.  This weapon can be used to "trip" an opponents mines
    after he has laid them but before he can distance himself from them,
    causing the mines to do damage to the opponents own ship. Issue the
    zipper command as follows;

        zipper

    Easy enough!
