   Galactic Empire 3.1
   System Operator Commands

   Please be aware that there are some system operator commands in Galactic
   Empire provided for your use. These also provide some assistance in 
   debugging problems. They can however give a player a distinct advantage 
   if discovered, and it is not recommended that they be used in the 
   production system all the time.

   The commands can be enabled by turning on the GESYSOP option in the 
   configuration options (MBMGEMSG.MSG)

   The sysop commands are as follows;

      
   SYS GET xxxxx <item name>
      This will grant to the ship xxxxx of the items requested. 
      Example: SYS GET 100 TOR  gets you 100 torpedoes.

   SYS KILL <userid> 
      Causes a player in the game to have his ship destroyed for unknown 
      reasons;
      Example SYS KILL GREMLIN  will kill gremlins ship

   SYS CASH xxxxx
      This will grant to the ship xxxxx C's of cash.
      Example: SYS CASH 999999  will give the ship 999999 in C's

   SYS GOTO x y
      This will move the ship to the sector in the universe with the specific
      x and y coordinates.
      Example: SYS GOTO 10 10   will move the ship to the x=10, y=10 sector.
   
   SYS SHIELDTYPE n
      This will give the current ship a shield of type n. Valid types are
      1 to 5.

   SYS PHASERTYPE n
      This will give the current ship a phaser type on n. Valid types are
      1 to 4.

   SYS CLASS n
      This will change the current ship to a ship class of n. Valid classes
      are 0 to 7. NOTE: IF you set the class to 8 or 9 (Cybertrons) I 
      cannot guarentee the outcome. GP's may result.

   SYS CLASSLIST
      This lists the current classes enabled in the game.

   SYS LIST 
      Lists all the ships currently active in the game, including cybertrons
      and droids.

   SYS HELP will list any new commands that I fail to get put in here.


   Please be aware that GE does not restrict the use of these commands to 
   the sysop only, as they may be used by him when on another acount to 
   change that players ship. It is your responsibility to determine if running
   the game with these commands activated is appropriate.


   Enjoy!
