    1.0   Overview

    Congratulations on purchasing the most popular add on to the MajorBBS.
    Galactic Empire has been installed in  MajorBBS's since 1988 and
    provided thousands of players an exciting and challenging game that
    continues to generate thousands of hours of usage. 

    Release 3.2 represents the latest in an ever evolving game of space
    battle and conquest. With the increased processing power and expanded
    memory available in today's systems, and the standardization provided
    by Galacticomm's release 6.0 of the MajorBBS, we are able to include
    many advanced features which just a few years ago would not have been
    possible.

    Galactic Empire 3.2 is simple to install and even simpler to
    operate. To get your game on-line and your users playing simply
    follow the instructions in the following section.

    NOTICE: The software is distributed to you un-registered. You can
    begin running it prior to registration. Send in the registration
    documentation (attached to this guide) immediately as there is a
    limited number of days it will operate without a Registration ID. 

    Upon receipt of your Registration Documentation you will be sent a 
    unique Registration ID valid for your specific MBBS system. Simply 
    enter this ID in the REGNO field in the configuration options.  For 
    further information refer to section 4.0 below.

    3.0   Operations

    Galactic Empire is designed to be simple to operate, requiring almost
    no intervention on your part. There are however some operational
    aspects which you may wish to consider.

    3.1    CPU Performance

    Galactic Empire is a complex game and depending on how configured can
    consume a sizable amount of CPU time. In order to maintain acceptable
    performance you must insure that your system is configured
    appropriately. The following parameters effect CPU performance
    dramatically and should be configured carefully for your specific
    CPU. 

    Note: The default parameters are set for performance on a 33 MHz 386 
    CPU. Your system's performance may vary and require changes to these 
    settings.

    MAXPLRS - Controls how many "real" players can be in the game at the
    same time. You may wish to limit this value to decrease the load on
    the CPU.

    SHOWOPT - Controls how many "GE" informational messages are generated.
    Leave set to "0" for optimal performance.

    PLANTOCK - Controls how frequently all the sectors in a Galaxy are
    updated. Setting this value lower increases CPU load.

    WORMODDS- This option controls the odds of a newly created planet
    being a wormhole instead. The lower then number the higher the odds.
    Since when a wormhole is created the destination wormhole sector also
    must be created, additional disk I/O must occur. The lower you set
    this number the more disk I/O you will experience. Depending upon the
    speed of your hard disk and cache this may or may not be a problem.

    NUMSHIPS - Controls how many "robot" ships are in the game. Set this
    value as high as you can, while maintaining acceptable performance.
    The more ships in the game, the more enjoyable it is. This value has
    the most dramatic effect on the CPU as each of the additional ships
    requires the same CPU resources as a live player.

    UNIVMAX - Controls the size of the Galaxy. You can reduce this number
    to control the number of sectors that the game has to process in the
    time specified by PLANTOCK above. Reducing this number decreases the
    CPU load. Because the Galaxy grows as the game is played you may
    notice decreased CPU performance as the game progresses for some
    time, and the databases grow correspondingly.



    3.2    Database Growth

    In order to insure that your game continues to operate un-interrupted,
    you must make sure that there is plenty of disk space available for
    database growth.

    The MBMGEUSR.DAT, MBMGESHP.DAT, MBMGEXRF.DAT, and MBMGEMAL.DAT are
    proportional to the number of users in the game. The MBMGEPLT.DAT
    database grows as more players explore the galaxy. Most sectors
    created will be void of planets and only take a small amount of
    storage. Since sectors are not created until a player actually scans
    it the total storage required is minimized. The average space
    required is 512 bytes per sector created.  Reserving 32,767,000 bytes
    (32.7 meg) for growth allows for about 64,000 sectors. If you have
    less space available you may consider decreasing the MAXPLREC option
    in the next section.

    Each time the system performs the nightly cleanup it will tell you the
    approximate size of the planet database. Additionally the MajorBBS
    allows you to display how much disk remains unused. If you have a
    relatively limited amount of disk storage please monitor these values
    regularly to insure the integrity of your entire system.

    3.3    Campaigns

    Galactic Empire is best when played in campaigns lasting 1 to 3
    months. You may wish to award players some additional bonus such as
    credits based upon their performance at the end of the campaign.

    When you reset a campaign simply initialize the Galactic Empire
    databases by typing the following while in your BBSV6 directory.

    COPY MBMGE*.NEW MBMGE*.DAT

    You can now begin a new campaign. You may wish to "tweak" some of the
    configuration options such as Galaxy Size, and/or ship configurations
    to vary a campaign from the previous one. See the following section
    for more details.



    3.4    System Operator Special Commands

    Included in Galactic Empire are several commands reserved specifically
    for your use. These commands are enabled with the SYSCMDS and SYSONLY
    options detailed in section 4.2 below. 

    These special commands provide some assistance in debugging problems.
    They can however give a player a distinct advantage if discovered,
    and it is not recommended that they be used in the production system
    all the time.  

    SYS GET xxxxx <item name> This will grant to the ship xxxxx of the
    items requested. Example: SYS GET 100 TOR  gets you 100 torpedoes.  

    SYS KILL <userid> Causes a player in the game to have his ship
    destroyed for unknown reasons.  Example SYS KILL GREMLIN  will kill
    Gremlins ship 

    SYS CASH xxxxx This will grant to the ship xxxxx C's of cash. 
    Example: SYS CASH 999999  will give the ship 999999 in C's 

    SYS GOTO x y This will move the ship to the sector in the universe
    with the specific x and y coordinates.  Example: SYS GOTO 10 10  will
    move the ship to the x=10, y=10 sector.  

    SYS SHIELDTYPE n This will give the current ship a shield of type n.
    Valid types are 1 to 5. A special type of 20 is an ultimate sysop
    shield.  

    SYS PHASERTYPE n This will give the current ship a phaser type on n.
    Valid types are 1 to 4. A special type of 20 is an ultimate sysop
    phaser.  

    SYS CLASS n This will change the current ship to a ship class of n.
    Valid classes are 0 to 7 and 13.  NOTE: IF you set the class to 8 or
    9 (Cybertrons) problems may result.

    SYS MAINT This will begin a fast Maintenance Procedure on the current
    ship regardless of your orbit status.

    SYS UNJAM This clears the effects  of a jammer on the current ship
    immediately. 

    SYS LIST This command lists all the active ships in the game, their
    location, and damage status.

    SYS CLASSLIST will list the classes currently loaded in the game. This
    will tell you what class the SYSOPIAN DEATH STAR is for the SYS CLASS
    command.


    3.5    Undocumented Commands

    In addition to the commands documented in the Galactic Empire Users
    Guide, there are a few special commands which are undocumented. There
    are two classes of undocumented commands;

    3.5.1   System Information Commands

    These commands are included to assist us in determining problems when
    you call for Technical Support.

    RG#   
    Reports the Galactic Empire Registration number, and Test Drive
    status.

    3.5.2     Special Terminal Program Commands

    These commands are included specifically to support terminal programs
    for Galactic Empire. As we further develop this interface more
    commands will be added.

    WHO 
    Provides the Users Name, and Systems MBBS Registration Number.
    This is for Terminal Programs which may be registered to a specific
    User, and/or System.

    DATA QAZWSX SCAN  
    Provides a comma separated data format scan for the
    current ship. This is useful for terminal programs that display the
    ship information in another (i.e. Graphical) representation.

    DATA QAZWSX REPORT 
    Provides a comma separated data format of all the
    information on the current ship. This is useful for terminal programs
    that display the ship information in another format.



    4.0   Options

    All of the configurable options are contained in the MBMGEMSG.MSG file
    and can be modified using the Galacticomm Configuration option on the
    BBS menu.

    The options are preset to optimal values. You need not adjust any to
    begin using the game. You may, however, wish to modify some of these
    options to challenge your players more, or provide a more interesting
    game. 

    Please note that some of the options are included to give you maximum
    configurability but modification is not recommended. These are
    indicated with a CAUTION note following the option description.

    Listed below are some of the more important options that you may wish
    to change. For a complete list of options please refer to the
    Configuration Options selection on the MajorBBS menu.



    4.1    Security Options

    Option:  REGNO
    Description:  Registration Number
    Value:  00000000
    Type:  String
    Range:  8 Characters

    This is the Registration Number specific to your MBBS system. This
    number will be sent to you upon receipt of your registration
    document. Galactic Empire will function fine for a limited period
    without this number. After the trial period your system will continue
    to function properly, although GE will be temporarily suspended. When
    you place the valid number in this field the game will continue where
    it left off.

    Option:  PLAYKEY 
    Description:  Key required to play GE
    Value:  NORMAL
    Type:  S
    Range:  15 

    This option defines the KEY the player must have to play GE. Refer to
    your MajorBBS Users Guide for a detailed explanation on Locks & Keys.



    Option:  SYSKEY
    Description:  Key required for sysop powers
    Value:  SYSOP
    Type:  S
    Range:  15 


    This defines the key required to use the special sysop commands. 
    You can set this to something other than SYSOP and then assign 
    that key to specific GAMEOP's or players as needed.



    4.2    Configuration Options

    Option:  MAXPLRS 
    Description:  The maximum players in the game at once
    Value:  30
    Type:  Numeric
    Range:  1 to  256

    You can limit the number of players who can simultaneously play the
    game. You may wish to set this value in order to keep your systems
    performance within an acceptable response.  The more players in the
    game the more CPU resources the game consumes.

    Option:  TRANSOPT 
    Description:  Allow goods transfers to planets not owned?
    Value:  NO
    Type:  Boolean
    Range:  YES/NO

    This option controls if a player is allowed to transfer goods to a
    planet which they do not own. If YES a player can transfer goods to
    another players planets. This could give players with multiple
    USERID's an unfair advantage as they could transfer goods from
    multiple accounts to a single account giving that account an initial
    boost in the game. Note: If you only permit paying accounts to play
    the game this is of less concern.

    Option:  SYSCMDS 
    Description:  Allow sysop commands?
    Value:  YES
    Type:  Boolean
    Range:  YES/NO

    This option enables the special SYSOP commands.  These commands are 
    documented in the SYSOP.DOC file included on the release diskette.
    Caution: This option WILL give an unfair advantage to players who use
    it. It is strongly recommended that it remain set to NO during normal
    operation or the SYSONLY option be set to YES.


    Option:  SYSONLY 
    Description:  Allow sysop only to use sysop commands?
    Value:  YES
    Type:  Boolean
    Range:  YES/NO

    If sysop commands are enabled are they restricted to players with
    SYSOP class only.  Caution: It is strongly recommended that this
    option remain set to YES.



    Option:  PLANTOCK
    Description:  How long to take to update all planets (seconds)? 
    Value:  21600
    Type:  Numeric
    Range:  1 to 32767

    This option controls the Dynamic Planet Update Feature. The system
    will monitor how long it takes to process through all the planets in
    the galaxy and dynamically adjust the update frequency to keep the
    total cycle time as close to the time below as it can.  Caution:
    Setting this value too small will cause the system to consume more
    CPU time than may be available. It is recommended that this value be
    set to 6 hours (21600 seconds) which will cause four updates a day. 
    After you have run a campaign you can reduce the value if CPU 
    performance remained acceptable throughout the campaign.

    Option:  PLODDS
    Description:  Frequency factor for planets 
    Value:  8
    Type:  Numeric
    Range:  1 to 20

    This value controls the odds of a sector having planets. The lower the
    number the more likely a sector will have planets.


    Option:  WORMODDS
    Description:  Frequency factor for wormholes 
    Value:  20
    Type:  Numeric
    Range:  1 to 100

    This value controls the odds of a sector having a wormhole. The lower
    the number the more likely a sector will have a wormhole

    Option:  NUMSHIPS 
    Description:  The number of additional ships (robots) in game?
    Value:  20
    Type:  Numeric
    Range:  0 to 256

    Depending upon your CPU's performance you can have up to 256
    additional Robotic Ships (Automatons) in the game. The system will
    randomly generate ships to give your players automated combatants.
    Caution: This value can DRAMATICALLY effect CPU  performance. If you
    are not confident about your specific system please set to a lower 
    value at first and experiment with increased values as you evaluate
    your CPU's performance.



    Option:  MAXDROID
    Description:  Max Droid class ships in game.
    Value:  10
    Type:  Numeric
    Range:  1 to 500

    This value limits the number of DROID class ships in the game at the
    same time. This insures that there are plenty of Cybertrons for
    players to fight.  The recommended setting is half of NUMSHIPS.

    Option:  UNIVMAX 
    Description:  The radius of the Virtual Galaxy
    Value:  32000
    Type:  Numeric
    Range:  10 to 32767

    This value controls how far from the center (sector 0 0) the galaxy
    extends. The Galaxy is square and UNIVMAX sectors in each direction
    (N,S,E,W).  NOTE: The size of the galaxy has some pretty dramatic
    effects on the game. You may with to try various values in each of
    your campaigns to determine which works best for you. 

    CAUTION: Do not change this value without resetting all the Galactic 
    Empire Databases as explained in Chapter 3.0. Failure to do so will 
    result in unexpected problems.

    Option:  MAXPLREC 
    Description:  The size of the GEPLANET.DAT in Kbytes
    Value:  32767
    Type:  Numeric
    Range:  0 to 32767

    This value controls how large the MBMGEPLT.DAT data file will grow to.
    Each time a sector is "teraformed" the MBMGEPLT.DAT database grows by
    the following formula; 

    space added = (number planets * 512) + 512

    In order to prevent your disk from filling up you can specify the
    maximum size that the database will grow to in Kbytes. When the
    maximum is reached no more planets will be created. 

    Note: a 32,767K database will hold 65,535 planets and sectors. That 
    should keep most players busy for awhile.



    4.3    Configuration Tables

    The following options concern two key tables that are provided to give
    you maximum flexibility over your systems "look and Feel".

    4.3.1    Sector 0 0 Planet Table

    This table configures the number of planets and the planet details for
    the neutral zone (sector 0 0). Some SYSOPS expressed an interest in
    being able to make this sector look like the SOL  System (our Solar
    System). You can modify the following table and add additional
    planets as required. The only constraint is that the game requires a
    Trading Planet, and a Population Planet. You can designate any planet
    you like to be each, but MUST have one and only one of each.

    Additionally, you can "give" the planet to a specific USERID, such as
    SYSOP. To do this change the owner option for the planet. This has
    the effect of allowing the owner to administer the planet as they
    would any other planet they own.

    The table is organized into sets of the following options. Each set is
    numbered as S00Pnxxx where Pn is the table entry, and xxx is the
    specific option. 

    If you elect to add additional planets to the table, simply copy the
    entire set (S00P1NM to S00P1RES) after the last option in the third
    table entry (S00P3RES). Change the P1 to P4 (or P5, P6, etc.) in the
    newly copied entries, and update the S00PLNUM option to reflect the
    new number of planets.

    Option:  S00PLNUM 
    Description:  Number of Planets in Sector 0 0
    Value:  3
    Type:  Numeric
    Range:  3 to 9

    This option specifies the number of planets in the neutral zone
    (sector 0 0). Note: You need not change this unless you want more
    than 3 planets in the Neutral Zone.




    Option:  S00P1NM
    Description:  Zygor
    Value:  
    Type:  String
    Range:  19 Characters

    This is the name of planet # 1 in the Neutral Zone.

    Option:  S00P1OWN
    Description:  Owner of Planet #1
    Value:  "*EMPIRE*"
    Type:  String
    Range:  30 Characters

    This field specifies the Owner of this planet. If desired you can
    specify a specific USERID and that user will be able to administer
    this planet.

    Option:  S00P1TYP
    Description:  Planet Type
    Value:  1
    Type:  Numeric
    Range:  0 to 2

    Type of planet indicator. One planet in Sector 0 0 -MUST- be each of
    the following types;

    0 = Nothing Special
    1 = Base trading planet (Zygor)
    2 = Population Planet (Tahanian Station)

    Option:  S00P1X
    Description:  X Coordinate of Planet
    Value:  5000
    Type:  Numeric
    Range:  100 to 9900

    This value specifies the X coordinate of this planet.



    Option:  S00P1Y
    Description:  Y Coordinate of Planet
    Value:  5000
    Type:  Numeric
    Range:  100 to 9900

    This value specifies the Y coordinate of this planet.

    Option:  S00P1ENV
    Description:  Environment for planet
    Value:  3
    Type:  Numeric
    Range:  0 to 3

    This value specifies the Environment for this Planet.

    0 = Poor
    1 = Marginal
    2 = Good
    3 = Very Good

    Option:  S00P1RES
    Description:  Resources for planet
    Value:  3
    Type:  Numeric
    Range:  0 to 3

    This value specifies the Resources for this Planet.

    0 = Poor
    1 = Marginal
    2 = Good
    3 = Very Good




    4.3.2    Ship Class Description Table

    The message file MBMGESHP.MSG controls the ships available in the
    game. You can modify the names, performance, weapons, and cargo 
    weight. You can also add additional ships to the table. 

    When adding additional ships simply use one of the unused entries
    between 1 and 41 in the table.

    Note: The rules concerning the addition of ships must be followed 
    carefully. 

      Add USER ships before the CYBORG ships.
      Add DROID ships after the CYBORG ships.
      Add any special sysop ships after the DROID ships.
      Set the NUMSHIPS option in the MBMGEMSG.MSG file to the sum of all
         the active SnnMAKE options in the MBMGESHP.MSG file.
