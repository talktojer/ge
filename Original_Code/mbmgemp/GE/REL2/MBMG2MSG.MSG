Define the KEY the player must have to play GE.

PLAYKEY {DEMO} S 15 Key required to play GE

This defines the key required to use the special
sysop commands. You can set this to something 
other than SYSOP and then assign that key to
specific GAMEOP's or players as needed.

SYSKEY {SYSOP} S 15 Key required for sysop powers

This is the Registration Number specific to YOUR system. 
This number will be sent to you upon receipt of your 
registration document. Galactic Empire will function fine
for a limited period without this number. After the 
trial period your system will continue to function 
properly, although GE will be temporarily suspended.
When you place the valid number in this field the game 
will continue where it left off.

You can limit the number of players who can simultaneously
play the game. You may with to set this value in order to
keep your systems performance within an acceptable
response.  The more players in the game the more CPU
resources the game consumes.

MAXPLRS {The maximum players in the game at once: 30} N 1 256

This option controls if non-paying players can enter the
game.  Set to 1 to allow non-paying players to pay, 0 to
restrict.

NOTE: In release 6.0 this field has no effect. Please
control this feature with the PLAYKEY field in the
Level 3 Security Options.

This option turns on some optional logging generally used
for debugging purposes. It is recommended that it remain 0
unless instructed to change it by our support staff.

0 = show minimal log messages
1 = show operational information messages
2 = show diagnostic messages
3 = show debugging messages

SHOWOPT {Show on log "GE:" messages at which level? 0} N 0 5

This option turns on extended trace logging generally used
for debugging purposes. It is recommended that it remain NO
unless instructed to change it by our support staff.

If enabled output is sent to GEOUT.LOG. Note, this file can
grow quite large if this option is left on.

LOGFLG {Enable extended trace logging? NO} B

This option specifies the filename of the user database. It
is provided to you in case you wish to store the datafiles
in a seperate directory.

is provided to you in case you wish to store the datafiles
in a seperate directory.

GEMAIL {MBMG2MAL.DAT} S 40 GE Mail Filename

This option specifies the filename of the planet database. It
is provided to you in case you wish to store the datafiles
in a seperate directory.

GEPLNT {MBMG2PLT.DAT} S 40 GE Planet Filename

This option controls if a player is allowed to transfer
goods to a planet which they do not own. If YES a player
can transfer goods to another players planets. This could
give players with multiple USERID's an unfair advantage as
they could transfer goods from multiple accounts to a
single account giving that account an initial boost in the
game. 

Note: If you only permit paying accounts to play the game
this is of less concern.

TRANSOPT {Allow goods transfers to planets not owned? YES} B

This option enables the special SYSOP commands. It is
STRONGLY recommended that you only turn this on when
specifically needed and leave it off otherwise.

SYSCMDS {Allow sysop commands? YES} B

If sysop commands are enabled are they restricted to
players with SYSOP class only.

SYSONLY {Allow sysop only to use sysop commands? YES} B

This option controls the Dynamic Planet Update Feature.
The system will monitor how long it takes to process 
through all the planets in the galaxy and dynamically
adjust the update frequency to keep the total cycle time as
close to the time below as it can.

Caution: Setting this value too small will cause the system
to consume more CPU time than may be available.  It is
recommended that this value be set to 6 hours (21600
seconds) which will cause four updates a day.

PLANTOCK {How long to take to update all planets (seconds)? 21600} N 1 32760

This value controls the odds of a sector having 
planets. The lower the number the more likely
a sector will have planets.

PLODDS {Frequency Factor for planets: 20} N 1 20

This value controls the odds of a sector having
a wormhole. The lower the number the more likely
a sector will have a wormhole.

WORMODDS {Frequency Factor for wormholes: 100} N 1 100

Depending upon your CPU's performance you can have up to
256 additional Robotic Ships (Automatons) in the game. 

Caution: This value can DRAMATICALLY effect CPU 
performance. If you are not confident about your specific
system please set to a lower value at first and experiment
with increased values as you evaluate your CPU's
performance.

NUMSHIPS {The number of additional ships (robots) in game? 6} N 0 500

This value limits the number of DROID class ships
insuring that there are plenty of CYBS for players.
Recommended setting is half of NUMSHIPS.

MAXDROID {Max droid class ships in game: 1} N 0 500

This value controls how far from the center (sector 0 0) 
the galaxy extends. The Galaxy is square and UNIVMAX
sectors in each direction (N,S,E,W).

NOTE: The size has some pretty dramatic effects on the
game. You may with to try various values in each of your
campaigns to determine which works best for you. 

DO NOT CHANGE THIS VALUE WITHOUT RESETTING ALL THE GALACTIC
EMPIRE DATABASES AS UNEXPECTED PROBLEMS -WILL- OCCUR!!!

UNIVMAX {The radius of the Virtual Galaxy: 10} N 10 32000

This value controls how large the GEPLANET.DAT data file
will grow to. Each time a sector is "teraformed" the 
GEPLANET.DAT database grows by the following formula; 
space added = (number planets * 512) + 512

In order to prevent your disk from filling up you can
specify the maximum size that the database will grow to in
Kbytes. When the maximum is reached no more planets will be
created. Note: a 32,767 database will hold 65,535 planets
and sectors. That should keep most players busy for awhile.

MAXPLREC {Max size of GEPLANET.DAT in Kbytes: 32767} N 10 32767

This option controls the range of the Torpedo Lock-on
function. It functions as a divisor to reduce the effective
range down from the maximum possible range of 50,000. The
specific formula for those who want to know is as follows;

IF (1.2-(speed/5000))*((5-distance)/(TORFACT/10))
IS GREATER THAN .7 LOCKON SUCCESSFUL

speed = opponents speed
distance = opponents distance (in sectors)

NOTE: Valid range is between 1 and 50.

TORFACT {Torpedo Lock-on divisor: 40} N 1 50

This option sets the maximum damage % a torpedo can 
do. It is factored in the game later with a random 
multiplier between .5 and 1.0 giving each torpedo a
damage factor between 50% and 100% of the value you 
specify here.

TDAMMAX {Torpedo Damage Maximum: 25} N 1 100

This option controls the speed of a torpedo. 
It is the distance the torpedo goes each "tic"
which is about 5 seconds.

TORPSPED {Speed of torpedo: 1181} N 1 10000

This option controls the range of the Missile Lock-on
function. It functions as a divisor to reduce the effective
range down from the maximum possible range of 50,000. The
specific formula for those who want to know is as follows;

IF ((5-distance)/(MISFACT/10))
IS GREATER THAN .7 LOCKON SUCCESSFULL

speed = opponents speed
distance = opponents distance 

NOTE: Valid range is between 1 and 50.

MISFACT {Missile Lock-on divisor: 25} N 1 50

This option sets the maximum damage % a missile can 
do. It is factored in the game later with a random 
multiplier between .5 and 1.0 and the power of the
missile. The exact formula is...
damage = (MDAMMAX/100)*(50000/missile power)*
         (random(.5)+random(.5);

MDAMMAX {Missile Damage Maximum: 25} N 1 100

This option controls the speed of a missile. 
It is the distance the missile goes each "tic"
which is about 5 seconds.

MISLSPED {Speed of missile: 850} N 1 10000

This option controls the maximum damage an Ion
Cannon can do each shot. It is factored in the 
game by a random multiplier of .5 to 1.0 giving
a maximum damage of 50% to 100% of IDAMMAX.

IDAMMAX {Maximum damage from Ion Cannon: 50} N 1 100

This option specifies the maximum number of 
mines which can be "ticking" at the same 
time. 

CAUTION: This option can dramatically effect 
CPU usage. Change carefully.

NUMMINES {Number of Mines "ticking": 10} N 1 200

This option controls the maximum damage a Mine
can do. It is factored later in the game by the 
distance from the ship. 


MNDAMMAX {Maximum damage a Mine can do: 50} N 1 200

This option controls the odds of a decoy snagging
a missile or torpedo. If the distance from the 
incoming object is less than 3000 then there is a 
one in DECODDS chance the decoy will snag it each
tic (every 5 seconds) cycle.

DECODDS {Odds of a decoy decoying: 8} N 1 20

This option controls the rate at which spontaneous repairs
occur to a damaged ship. The value is specified in 
percent of damage reduced each cycle. 

Values above 10 are not recommended as repairs would 
occur so fast that it might be too difficult to kill
a ship.

REPAIRRT {Rate of repair in %: 25} N 1 50

This option controls the effective distance of the 
Hyperphasers. Increase to extend their range, decrease
to shorten.

HPFIRDST {Hyperphaser distance factor: 3} N 1 20

This option controls the amount of damage a hyperphaser
does. Increase to cause more damage per shot, decrease
to reduce. Because this is factored down by range and
phaser type you can set the value to numbers greater
than 100.

HPDAMMAX {Hyperphaser maximum damage: 35} N 1 200

This option controls the effective distance of the 
Hyperphasers. Increase to extend their range, decrease
to shorten.

PFIRDST {Phaser distance factor: 3} N 1 20

This option controls the amount of damage a phaser
does. Increase to cause more damage per shot, decrease
to reduce. Because this is factored down by range and
phaser type you can set the value to numbers greater
than 100.

PDAMMAX {Phaser maximum damage: 35} N 1 200

This option controls the duration of a jammer.
It is factored in the game by the distance 
from the ship that launches it.

JAMTIME {How long do Jammers last: 6} N 1 10

This option specifies how much energy the cloaking system
draws during each tick cycle. 

CLENGUSE {How much does Cloak draw each tick: 2600} N 1 32000

This option controls how many days mail messages
are queued before deletion.

This option specifies the distance Cyb's will allow 
non-combative classes of ships to approach before they
consider the approach an aggressive act. This value is
modified in the code using the following formula on a
case by case basis.

distance = TOOCLOSE + random(TOOCLOSE)

The range is therefore TOOCLOSE to 2*TOOCLOSE

TOOCLOSE {How close do Cybs allow players to get: 1000 } N 1 32000

This option specifies the upper limit of the 
random gold given to a Cyb each time they
are created. Increase this value if you 
would like to put more value in shooting
down cybs.

CYBGOLD {Max amount of gold a cyb gets: 25} N 0 32000

This option specifies the number of planets in the neutral
zone (sector 0 0). 

Note: You need not change this unless you want more than
