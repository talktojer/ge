It is 3250 in the standard year, 975 years since man has developed inter-planetary space navigation. Galactic Empire (GE) is a space exploration and conquest module for Worldgroup BBS systems written in C.

## History

Galactic Empire was written by [Mike Murdock](https://github.com/mmurdock58) and originally released under the [GNU General Public License (GPLv2)](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/old-licenses/gpl-2.0.en.html) in 2002. 

A [SourceForge](https://sourceforge.net/) [project](https://sourceforge.net/projects/gnu-ge/) was setup in 2002 to house the GPLv2 version then moved to [GitHub](https://github.com/) in 2016.

The code was ported by [Bil Simser](https://github.com/bsimser) to Borland 5.01, Visual C++ 6, and the free Borland compiler after the Major BBS version was released by Mike. A port was underway to get GE running on World Group 3.2 but never completed.
